              "Heat a little of the oil in a deep frying pan and cook the onions until soft. Add the ginger and cook for 1 min, then stir in the turmeric, chilli powder and coriander and cook for 1-2 mins or until fragrant. Add the coconut milk, most of the chillies and the mango chutney, bring to a simmer and cook for 5 mins.",
              "Meanwhile, heat the rest of the oil in a frying pan or wok. Peel the eggs and stir them around in the hot oil until they brown and start to bubble and crisp all over. Lift them carefully out of the pan and halve them.",
              "Roughly chop the coriander and stir most of it into the masala with some salt. Add the eggs, scatter the rest of the chilli and coriander over the top and serve with the rice."
